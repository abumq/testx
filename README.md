# Overview
TestX is very simple single header to create typesafe test data for your testing framework. You simply make test data by specifying the types for each parameter and use them accordingly

# Usage

```c++
#include <testx.h>

using namespace muflihun::testx;

//              c    expected
static TestData<char, bool> IsDigitTestData = {
  TestCase('1', true),
  TestCase('a', false),
}
```

You can use `std::get` to get item without specifying the type

```c++
void testNumber() {
    for (auto& item : IsDigitTestData) {
        auto c = item.get<0>();
        bool expected = item.get<1>();
        assert(isdigit(c) == expected));
    }

}
```

You may have trouble creating some test cases that contain implicit contructors e.g, `std::string`

For them you will need to either specify the type or explicitely contruct the object:

```
    TestCase<std::string, bool>("string", true);
```

or

```
    TestCase(std::string("string"), true);
```
